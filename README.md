# Mock_project_Acacia_saligna
This repository contains data collected in UWC's Cape Flats Nature Reserve on the density of the invasive Acacia saligna between 2019 and 2024. 
Data was collected by 3rd year students in the Biodiversity & Conservation Biology department at the University of the Western Cape. Every year, students undergo an alien plant removal exercise on the reserve, where plants are cleared using a combination of mechanical and chemical methods. This happens in addition to the regular removals conducted by the nature reserve staff - Note that no clearing took place in 2021. For data collection, the total numbers of Acacia saligna plants were recorded, as well as the numbers of adult plants (> 50 cm in height) and seedlings (< 50 cm in height). Densities of each were calculated from this. In addition, the number of other species present were recorded in each quadrat, in order to determine species richness. Seven quadrats of 4x4 m were set up in each of three areas, these being Strandveld, Ecotone (=transition zone), and Sand Fynbos. The data serves to temporally assess the density and population structure of Acacia saligna and the impact and removal of invasive alien vegetation in the Cape Flats Nature Reserve.
A googlesheet with the collected data was made available to all students in the 3rd year BCB class of 2024.
